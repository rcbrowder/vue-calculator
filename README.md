# Vue Calculator

## Purpose

This application will function as a standard non-scientific calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The display at the top will show the current numerical input before a mathematical operation is executed by the user (pressing '='). After an operation is executed the top display will show the result of the operation.

The side display will function like a tape register - logging inputs and outputs at the bottom while moving each previous item upwards. This display will be scrollable.

## Installation
